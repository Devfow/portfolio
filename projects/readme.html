<p> Balatro-Like Game  
A simplified web-based interpretation of *Balatro*, built around poker-hand mechanics.  
Players score points by building hands, progressing through increasingly difficult levels with stackable upgrades —  
a procedural meditation on chance and progression.</p>

<p> Datascape  
A hypertext-driven atmospheric experience inspired by Mark Amerika’s *GRAMMATRON*.  
Presented as a nonlinear digital space that encourages exploration of fractured meaning and immersive ambiguity.</p>

<p> Depressing Adventure  
A web-based text narrative focusing on a protagonist experiencing extreme depression.  
Intentionally sparse and bleak, it offers a raw, unfiltered dive into emotional stasis and existential fatigue.</p>

<p> Flesh Syzygy  
A top-down roguelike dungeon crawler with procedural level generation.  
Players navigate using arrow keys through surreal environments infused with decay.</p>

<p> Synaptic Decay  
A compact yet philosophically ambitious text adventure  
where player character actions are dynamically altered based on previously triggered emotional states.  
Explores memory, manipulation, and fractured agency in interactive storytelling.</p>
